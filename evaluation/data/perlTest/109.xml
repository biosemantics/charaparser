Stems 5–15, weakly erect, green, 25–90 cm; internodes angular to grooved, 2/3–3 times as long as leaves, shiny, glabrous except for fine hairs at nodes. Leaves connate basally, with scarious sheath 0.2–0.5 mm, sessile; blade 1-veined (vein prominent abaxially), linear to linear-lanceolate, 20–55 × 2–7 mm, herbaceous to subsucculent, margins ± flat, scarious, shiny, ciliate, apex acute or acuminate to cuspidate, sometimes pustulate, sparsely pubescent on adaxial surface; axillary leaf clusters absent. Inflorescences axillary, solitary flowers. Pedicels reflexed in fruit, 20–50 mm, glabrous. Flowers: sepals green, obscurely 1-veined, not keeled, broadly elliptic (herbaceous portion narrowly elliptic), 2.8–3.5 mm, to ca. 4 mm in fruit, apex obtuse to rounded, not pustulate, minutely ciliate basally; petals ovate, 5–6 mm, 11/2–2 times as long as sepals, apex rounded. Capsules tightly enclosed by calyx, ovoid, 4 mm, ca. equaling sepals. Seeds 15–20, dark brown, reniform, compressed, 0.8–0.9 mm, shiny, smooth.</description><phenology>spring</phenology><phenology>mar</phenology><phenology>apr</phenology><phenology>may</phenology><phenology>summer</phenology><phenology>jun</phenology><phenology>jul</phenology><phenology>aug</phenology><habitat>boggy meadows</habitat><habitat>freshwater marshes</habitat><conservation>of conservation concern;</conservation><elevation>0–300 m;</elevation><us_distribution>Calif.</us_distribution><global_distribution>c Mexico</global_distribution><global_distribution>Central America (Guatemala).</global_distribution><discussion>Arenaria paludicola is federally listed as endangered, and now is known only from a few sites in San Luis Obispo County; urban development and resultant habitat conversion have impacted it significantly.
