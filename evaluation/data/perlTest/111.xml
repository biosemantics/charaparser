  <description>Plants annual. Taproots filiform. Stems 1–100+, erect to ascending or sprawling,
    green, 3–40+ cm; internodes terete to ellipsoid, 2–8 times as long as leaves, dull, retrorsely
    pubescent throughout, sometimes also stipitate-glandu-lar. Leaves often connate basally, with
    scarious or mostly herba-ceous sheath 0.2–0.3 mm, petiolate (proximal leaves) or usually
    sessile; petiole 1–4 mm; blade 3–5 veined, elliptic to broadly ovate or rarely orbiculate, 2–7 ×
    1–4 mm, herbaceous, margins flat, herbaceous, dull, ciliate especially proximally, apex acute to
    acuminate, pustulate, sparsely minutely pubescent or glabrous; axillary leaf clusters absent.
    Inflorescences terminal, open, leafy, 3–50+-flowered cymes. Pedicels erect or ascending in
    fruit, 1–12 mm, retrorsely pubescent. Flowers: sepals green, often prominently 3-veined, not
    keeled, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate (herbaceous portion narrowly elliptic to broadly
    lanceolate), 2–3 mm, to 4 mm in fruit, apex narrowly acute to acuminate, ± minutely pustulate,
    stipitate-glandular; petals oblong, 0.6–2.7 mm, 1/5–3/4 times as long as sepals, apex obtuse to
    rounded. Capsules loosely enclosed by calyx, ovoid to cylindric-ovoid, 3–3.5 mm, 4/5–11/5 times
    as long as sepals. Seeds 10–15, ashy black, reniform, plump, 0.4–0.6 mm, not shiny, with
    low-elongate, prominent tubercules.</description>

  <discussion>Variation in Arenaria serpyllifolia in the broad sense is treated in various ways. The
    two varieties recognized here have been treated also as subspecies (e.g., A. O. Chater and G.
    Halliday 1993) or species (e.g., M. N. Abuhadra 2000; B. Jonsell 2001). Jonsell admitted that
    accepting them as species is questionable; while the morphological differences are slight (see
    esp. Abuhadra), the ploidy-level difference (2n = 40 in var. serpyllifolia vs. 2n = 20 in var.
    tenuior) is important.</discussion>
