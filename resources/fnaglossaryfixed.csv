Any taxon whose life cycle is confined to one or the other phase is limited to asexual means of reproduction, since sexual reproduction and consequent genetic recombination are impossible without alternation between haploid and diploid states via meiosis and fertilization.  The term gametophytic applies to any part of the haploid phase, including all unicellular to multicellular entities belonging to it, whereas gametophyte is reserved for the principal and directly gamete-producing stage of that phase.  In all vascular plant taxa the sporophyte is the dominant and most conspicuous phase of the life cycle.  The gametophytes of 'lower' vascular plants (ferns and 'fern-allies') are physically independent of the sporophytes and, though inconspicuous, merit description in their own rights.  Those of gymnosperms and angiosperms are minute and physically dependent upon (contained within) sporophytic structures and are not usually included in morphological descriptions.  In the flowering plants at least, the haploid phase is (presumably evolutionarily) reduced to such a degree that the existence of gametophytes per se is debatable.","PLANT",NULL,"1","3e8c8c90-2ada-4e94-b4d1-79df39321a8f"

"49062","pubescence","CHARACTER",,,"Collective aspect of trichomes borne on the surface.  Many of the terms traditionally used for describing pubescence have been defined and used in so many differing and often contradictory ways that they have become hopelessly ambiguous.  This is attributable mainly to overdefinition within this portion of the traditional lexicon - that is, to highly arbitrary and widely variant restriction of a term's scope to some one detailed combination of trichome character states (shape, size, orientation, etc.).  By derivation these are essentially general terms, really suited only for denoting overall aspect.  The diversity actually encountered in nature defies comprehensive and unambiguous resolution into any limited suite of precisely specified, mutually exclusive, complex character states that can be associated with these terms, which are best used only in their general senses.  Sometimes, such description will be sufficient in itself; more often, additionally or alternatively, the various attributes of the individual trichomes should be described.  This is the only strategy that allows for full description of any possible condition, including the presence of more than one type of trichome.  The various terms used for describing pubescence have never been semantically consistent; in some cases they refer to the trichomes themselves, while in others they apply to the bearing surface or structure; e.g., sericeous (the trichomes themselves are collectively silky) versus barbate (the structure is bearded).
